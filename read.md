# Replication package for paper "Robust Device Authentication with Zero-Cost NAS and Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer"
## üîç Framework Overview

![ZNAX Framework](./ZNAX.PNG)
> Figure: A Conceptual Overview 

The proposed framework leverages Zero-Cost NAS for optimal configuration discovery and employs a cross-domain knowledge transfer approach to address data scarcity. It is dubbed ZNAX, where Z stands for Zero-Cost, NA for NAS, and X for Cross-domain. ZNAX operates in three sequential stages: Zero-Cost NAS-based ViT architecture search, a pre-training phase consisting of contrastive training and domain alignment, and supervised fine-tuning on target RF data with a few samples.
This repository provides the implementation of **ZNAX**, a framework designed for robust and efficient Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) using:

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Zero-Cost Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** to find optimal Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures without full training
- üåê **Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer** to overcome RF data scarcity using contrastive learning and domain alignment

ZNAX enables lightweight, generalizable RF device authentication using minimal labeled data, making it ideal for edge computing scenarios.

## üß† Pipeline Stages

### 1. Zero-Cost NAS
- Searches ViT configurations based on discriminability, trainability, cohesiveness, and attention diversity
- Uses a single forward-backward pass per architecture and evolutionary ranking

### 2. Cross-Domain Pre-Training
- Transfers knowledge from a source image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST) to RF domain
- Uses dual-margin contrastive loss and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to align feature distributions

### 3. Supervised Fine-Tuning
- Trains the ViT encoder and classifier on a small labeled RF dataset for final emitter classification
